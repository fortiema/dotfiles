# Dotfiles

Collection of files used to setup and customize my macOS systems (from scratch).

Inspired by many other dotfiles repository, but special shoutout to <https://github.com/driesvints/dotfiles>!

## Usage

```bash
git clone git@github.com:fortiema/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
~/.dotfiles/install.sh
```
